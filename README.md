#This app was built as a project for our first android course we had in HKR

* The app idea is to let people post and join events.
* Create group chats related to the events.
* Authurize and authenticate login using firebase Database.
* Add friends and set up a profile.
* A map available to show the events for the users, each event on the map can be clicked and a popup window will desplay the event infomation and a join button.
* Login to facebook and be able to share
